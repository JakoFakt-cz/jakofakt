## ðŸª› How to install?

Before you start to use the repo, you need to download dependencies, you can do that by running command below.
***Note: You can also run this command if you're missing dependencies and have already used the repo***

```bash
bun install
```

If you need to update dependencies, you can use command below

```bash
bun update
```

After making sure you have all the dependencies and made any changes (if you intended do any), you can test-run your project by running command below.

```bash
bun dev
```

*This command is alias of `turbo dev`.*
