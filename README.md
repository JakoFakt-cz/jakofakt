## üñ•Ô∏è How to test & deploy?

### üß™ Deploying locally (for testing purposes)

Deploying locally is generally used for testing purposes and is not intended to be used in production in any way. 
We have already setupped areas where are services deployed. currently you can change frontend's in the command script and backend's in `src/main.ts` file by changing the const value.

- Frontend is deployed on port 3000 (increments automatically if port is used)
- Backend is deployed on port 4000

> üí° *Tip:* This command is alias of `turbo dev`.
> 
```bash
bun dev
```

&nbsp;

### üåê Deploying into production

Deploying into production is automatic and shouldn't really be required for doing anything beside that. 
Both repos have individual ways of deploying into production.

#### Frontend

```bash
bun --filter 'frontend' build
```

#### Backend

```bash
bun --filter 'backend' start:prod
```
